## Details for Teaching Team
Wheel of Vernier is based on code developed during a two week bootcamp on building web applications. The orginal code used Adobe Brackets and Cordova. Cordova is not compatible with dynamic server side programming. The first part of the app is modeled on FooBooks. Game Play uses jQuery Mobile. The game is meant to be used by students on using their own mobile devices.
